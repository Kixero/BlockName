# BlockName

A simple Minecraft plugin to set a names to blocks and to display them in the players' actionbar when they look at it.

## Usage

The usage is really simple, to set or change a block's name just look at it and type the command : 
 
 `/blockname <Name>`
 
 To remove a block's name type this command while looking at the block :
 
 `/blockname remove`
